# ch15-HottestRestaurant

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with vanilla javascript. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.

Our deployed server: [Heroku](https://dry-bayou-00961.herokuapp.com/)

## Notes

* You will NOT need a MySQL Database for this exercise.
* Current app doesn't have admin handling. We'll deal with that at a later time.
* Don't separate the JavaScript from the HTML in the client-side code. (i.e. Don't use external JavaScript. If you do, you will need an additional line of code to configure the express server to know where the JavaScript is).
